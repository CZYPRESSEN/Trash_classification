# Trash_classification
一眼丁真，鉴定为纯纯的trash  
Training framework --> tensorflow / Pytorch
Vitural python enviroment --> conda python=3.10 / 3.11 / 3.12 
Training require -->   tensorflow opencv-python numpy(TensorflowVision)/torch opencv-python numpy torchvision (TorchVision)
Inference require -->  tensorflow opencv-python numpy(TensorflowVision)/torch opencv-python numpy (TorchVision)
## Tips
(1): The version compatibility of tensorflow is very poor, don't think about training with versions other than python 3.10
(2): Don't use cpu to train the model, it's very^2 slow
